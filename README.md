# Smart Traffic Management System

An intelligent traffic management solution that optimizes traffic flow at intersections using computer vision and AI technologies. This project was developed by Team Quantum Coders for the Codarambha Hackathon.

## 🚦 Overview

The system uses real-time video processing to detect vehicles, track their movement, and intelligently control traffic signals to minimize congestion and waiting times at intersections.

## ✨ Key Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
- Multi-lane traffic monitoring
- Intelligent traffic signal timing optimization
- Web-based visualization dashboard
- Traffic simulation for testing scenarios
- Intersection geometry mapping

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- YOLOv8 for object detection
- OpenCV for image processing
- Flask for web interface
- JavaScript for frontend visualization
